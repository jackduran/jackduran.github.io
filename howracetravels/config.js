    title: 'How Race TRavels: THE MIGRATORY RACIAL AFFECTS OF DOMINICAN MIGRATION From Africa to New York',
    subtitle: 'by Jack Duran',
    byline: 'This is a story of how race travels. From early forced movements of the slave trade in the 16th century, to voluntarily and economically-driven movements in the past century, Dominicans have in been constant migration since before the founding of the Dominican Republic. Today, Dominicans comprise the largest immigrant group in New York City, with Washington Heights being dubbed “Little Santo Domingo.” And, though these migrations are often spurred by desire for economic mobility and opportunity, less studied is how the racial affects of Dominicans also migrate with them. These migratory racial affects which migrate with Dominicans complicate not only Americans` own understanding of race, but also Dominicans’ — and consequently Dominican immigrants` own understandng of what it means to be Dominican. This visual essay and interactive map explores the history of the migration of Dominican people and how their racial imaginaries travel from Africa to Hispañola to the United States, where Dominicans` open and elastic self-concept of race is challenged and reconfigured, inducing a state of racial affective disorientation — an identity crisis that prompts Dominican immigrants to develop new social consiousness` when they migrate to the U.S.',

            description: 'Often overlooked in studies about the origins and migration patterns of transatlantic slavery is that present-day Dominican Republic, formerly the Spanish colony of La Española and Santo Domingo and where Christopher Columbus landed on his voyage of 1492, is where the first Black Africans arrived and were enslaved in the Americas. These were the first Black people in the Western Hemisphere. This is where transatlantic slavery began. It ushered in, as Silvio Torres-Saillant (2010) argues, “a social and demographic history that would lead in the course of five centuries to the overwhelming presence of people of African descent in the Dominican Republic today.” What is more, this social and demographic history would come to travel with Dominicans wherever they migrate, especially New York City, where a dotted line can be drawn between 20th and 21st century Dominican migration to the U.S. and the very first Middle Passage that inaugurated the transatlantic slave trade.',

No society felt the repercussions of this tumultuous political upheaval more than the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo, on the eastern end of the island of Hispaniola.” By 1801, amid the Haitian revolutionary war for independence from France, Toussaint L’Ouverture captured Santo Domingo to expand his sphere of control and unify the island. However, with the threat of a French invasion looming, he returned to Saint Dominique where independence would subsequently be achieved in 1804. Santo Domingo returned to Spanish control in 1809, but with fears of a French incursion being planned from the eastern side of the island in Santo Domingo, Haitian president Jean-Pierre Boyer invaded Santo Domingo again in 1822 with the intent of unifying the island to oppose a future European invasion and the restoration of slavery on the island. However, these Haitian efforts to unify the island were seen by the white and mulatto populations of Santo Domingo as an existential threat and marked the beginning of future Dominican antipathy toward Haiti, which sparked a war for Dominican independence in February 1844. Indeed, the Dominican Republic is the only country in the Americas to have gained its independence from another former colony: Haiti.',

            description: 'The image above displays one of the Dominican Republic’s foremost founding fathers, akin to George Washington, planning war against Haitian occupation. We can see how the composition of the painting, and the white Dominicans leading this campaign in it, portrays Dominican independence in the same light as American independence — giving this independence war racial overtones that signified an almost cosmic battle between the Europeanness that the Dominicans sought to preserve and the Africanness of Haiti that they sought to repel and banish. This island, like this war, was and still is battleground between two worlds: one which seeks to repel European colonialism and the other which is nostalgic for it. In fact, in the decades following the war, the new Dominican government, under threat of Haitian invasion, requested to be annexed by the U.S. to protect itself from Haiti. United States President Ulysses S. Grant proposed annexing Santo Domingo to the U.S. as a protectorate in 1869, with the promise of eventual statehood, but the effort failed in Congress because legislators opposed granting statehood to a people of mixed-race. However, the effort to find protection from Haitians, former slaves, with the U.S. points to the formation of a collective deracialized identity and mentality among the mixed population of the Dominican Republic that enabled them, and still do, to identify themselves in contrast to Haitians and the threat of a unified Black sovereignty on this island. Dominican Independence Day today, which is celebrated annually with much fervor and pomp and circumstance from the Dominican Republic to the massive parades in New York City, marks the day that the Dominican Republic declared its independence from Haiti. Paulino argues, “What Haitians called ‘unification’ was designed to protect their country from re-enslavement. But the Spanish colonists (particularly the white and mulatto slave owners) on the eastern end of the island saw it as an invasion.” And, it was this expulsion of the Haitians in 1844 that, Paulino argues, became the seed of Dominican nationhood and identity and which would be manipulated by the country’s elite for centuries to cast Haitians as invaders and Haitian migration as an invasion. Indeed, as Paulino notes, “From its inception, then, the Dominican nation (particularly as constructed by its elites) has literally been based on the rejection of Haiti.”',

In this case, people suspected of being Haitians because of their Black skin were lined up on the border. Dominican soldiers held parsley stems up and demanded they pronounce the Spanish word for parsley: “perejil.” Because “Rs” in Spanish are rolled, if Haitians, because of their French Creole, could not properly pronounce the word, they would be executed on the spot.

He argues, “Dominicans believe that they should not be held accountable for this brutal act. Moreover, during the recent wave of deportations, many Dominicans, in numerous conversations, eerily and nostalgically recalled the 1937 massacre as a valid response to the overwhelming and unwanted Haitian presence in their country. The failure to apologize and publicly assume responsibility for the massacre has left an anti-Haitian legacy whereby the political exclusion and physical removal of Haitians from the Dominican nation is generally justified and condoned.”',

Indeed, Paulino has argued, “Because of its remoteness and the state’s inability to control the region the border became a laboratory for the application of national identity policies and a political and economic catalyst in the development of Hispaniola.” The border was used by Trujillo — who was called “El Jefe” or “The Boss” — as a necro-political eugenic laboratory whose technological function was and is to filter the racial makeup of Dominican society, much in the same way Nazi death camps were laboratories, as Nadège Veldwachter (2020) points out. And these laboratorial experiments were planned from the Presidential Palace in the nation`s capital, the former seat of Spanish imperial power and the birthplace of transatlantic slavery, in what is today called "La Zona Colonial" or the "Colonial Zone" of the capital, Santo Domingo. Furthermore, Veldwachter argues, “[T]he rhetorical similarities between Dominican and Nazi propaganda used during World War II to construct Haitians and Jews as Others to be excluded from the process of national formation in Europe and the Caribbean.” Furthermore, she points out parallels between Dominicans’ rationalization of the 1937 massacre of Haitians and the genocide of European Jewry during the Holocaust, and that “both discourses resonated with German and Dominican nation-state ideals embedded in comparable theories about race, economic growth, and culture.” These ideals were and are embedded in colonial mentalities that work to reproduce the colonial laboratories of the past in the present.',

Inaugurated in 1992, in celebration of Columbus’ 1492 voyage to Santo Domingo, in this very “colonial zone,” the Lighthouse is a massive building shaped like cross. Like an upright cross whose verticality signals towards the sky, the heavens, the verticality of the cross that this building represents points eastward toward the motherland, Spain, where beams of light from the building, reproducing the semiotics of a colonial lighthouse, are projected toward Europe. The sanctification of Columbus, and thus whiteness, in Dominican imaginaries, which is also reflected in the center emblem of the country’s flag, is further reflected in the fact that the lighthouse, which is functions like a cathedral, is said by Dominican authorities to house the Columbus’ remains. Although Spanish authorities have refuted this, Dominican authorities have refused to allow any DNA tests on the remains — indicating how much Dominican identity hinges on and yearns for the racial imaginaries embodied in Columbus and whiteness vis a vis the Blackness that Haitianness and Africanness represents.',

The Haitians then were transported like cattle to isolated killing grounds. The soldiers slaughtered them at night, then carried the corpses to the Atlantic Ocean, at the customs port in Montecristi, and threw the bodies to the sharks. For days, the waves carried uneaten body parts until they washed up on the beaches.” We can see how the colonial laboratories of the transatlantic slave trade are reproduced within Dominican society in the mid-twentieth century. The corpses and body parts of Haitians thrown into The Atlantic, to the sharks, washing up on the beach, evokes the semiotics of the slave ship and of Middle Passage where Black people would be thrown off the slave ship into the Atlantic, to be swallowed by the waves and the sharks. The semiotics of discarding Haitians off of the Montecristi port, a historical colonial port, as if to undo or reverse the entry of African Blackness onto this island centuries ago, is significant. Wucker further illustrates the colonial nostalgia for white sovereignty over Hispaniola, saying, “Often, the soldiers did not even bother with the charade of covering up their crimes. Entire families were mutilated in their homes. For Haitians away from their homes, in the streets or in the fields, the soldiers applied a simple test. Since Haitians are considerably darker than most Dominicans, soldiers would accost a man or woman with dark skin.”',

            description: 'While Trujillo’s oppressive and violent immigration policies and discourses against Haitians were modeled after Nazi policies and discourses, his immigration policies were also characterized by an open-door policy that favored white immigrants. One of the foremost examples of this is the Dominican government’s acceptance of European Jews fleeing the Holocaust (as shown in the image above), when other countries were not willing to open their doors to them (Veldwachter 2020). The Trujillo government used this open-door policy to signal that the Dominican government was committed to humanitarianism and protecting political refugees and migration, but this is starkly contrasted against the brutal treatment of Haitians by Dominicans on the basis of race. In other words, the Dominican government had a closed door policy toward Black migration — which it associates with Haitian invasion — and an open door policy toward white migration. In the 1930s and 1940’s, this was reflected in Dominicans’ openness to Jewish migration, today this is reflected in white American and European tourism and vacationing. The irony is that the same tactics that Nazis used to exterminate Jews and which Jews were fleeing from, were actively being used by Dominicans on Haitians, while accepting 100,000 Jews to the country (Margolis 2018). At the same time, the Trujillo government imposed strict restrictions on outward immigration by Dominicans. With its borders as a laboratory, these immigration policies where designed to incubate the Dominican Republic as a eugenics experiment. Although Trujillo signaled that his government’s acceptance of Jews to the Dominican Republic was humanitarian in nature, his immigration policies were designed to prevent Dominicans from leaving, while absorbing Jewish European refugees, in order to facilitate the further lightening of the “complexion” of the mixed Dominican population, in the same way Spanish colonists mixed with African slaves centuries before, while at the same time purging Haitians, and thus Blackness, from the country.',

These practices undertaken by darker-skinned Dominican populations potentially subject to state terrorism, though many might ascribe them as a blanket rejection of Blackness, are actually more complex than this. These whitening practices were undertaken as survival in a society where to be perceived as Black was to be perceived Haitian and therefore executed. It partly sheds light on why Dominicans, for the most part, do not identify as African-descended or Black. The legacy of racial targeting in this era has shaped Dominican racial imaginaries and racial affects for decades that still are ingrained in the mindsets of Dominicans, still haunt them, still shape their behavior, These racial affects and identities developed partly out of collective trauma from this white supremacist racial terror, which continues today, migrate with Dominicans wherever they go, including, and most especially, in New York City.',

            description: 'Though migration slowly trickled into as Trujillo’s rule weakened in the 1950’s, following his assassination in 1961 and the end of his iron fisted rule, the political situation deteriorated so much that it prompted a wave of migration to the U.S. From Trujillo’s cronies looking for revenge on the assassination of their leader to a coup d`etat that overthrew the acting president and sparked a civil war, the political instability of this climate prompted many Dominicans — particularly those fleeing political repression — to migrate to the U.S. en masse (Haggerty 1989). With the U.S. intervention into the civil war in 1965, and the passage of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than European groups, Dominican migration exponentially accelerated in the following decade. The first wave of Dominican migration to mostly the New York City area, the Migration Policy Institute says, was composed of well-off individuals, as well as people from urban and small-town middle and lower-middle classes. In 1960, the Dominican population in the U.S. was at 12,000, according to the Migration Policy Institute. By 1980, there were 169,000 Dominicans in the U.S., primarily in the New York City area. This first mass wave created community networks in the U.S. that assisted the future arrivals of more Dominican immigrants.',

In an NBC interview on Dominican Americans, César Vargas, who arrived from the Dominican Republic when he was 13 years old and is now a writer in New York City, recounts, “Back then being a Dominican put a target on your back in certain neighborhoods. Many Dominicans even "passed" for Puerto Rican in order to be allowed into certain places, or even downplayed their culture, changed their accent, and refused to talk about nationality for fear being stereotyped," he said. "The anti-Dominican sentiment ran amok. It’s different now.” The targeting that Dominicans experienced, which forced them to change their accent, to refuse to talk about their nationality, to try to pass as as another group for access, illustrates how Dominicans upon migrating to the U.S. face a kind of racial and ethnic discrimination that evokes the discrimination faced by Haitians back at home. Their racial affects which travel with them — what Torres-Saillant calls a “deracialized social consciousness” in which they do not identify as any one race — defy and are challenged by American binary racial codes that insists on their racial classification. For darker-skinned Dominicans, this means, being classified as Black upon arrival — disorienting their “deracialized social consciousness” which has been manipulated by Dominican elites, as Torres-Saillant notes, to convince them that “blackness is inconsistent with Dominicanness” (41). Indeed, he notes, “[T]he racialized view, which conceived Haiti as the exclusive container of blackness, may have influenced the Dominican imagination, giving currency to a tendency among Dominicans to see themselves as not black.”',

But, in the U.S., Torres-Saillant, argues, “[C]ountless Dominicans, particularly dark-skinned ones, find themselves having to choose among options which their historical experience did not prepare them to recognize.” This causes, what I argue is, a racial affective disorientation in which Dominican immigrants’ conception of race is completely reconfigured by racial codes that transfigures them as “Black,” even when they might not identify as such. “Dominicans cannot help but realize that in the United States race matters tremendously, ours as well as that of others. In this country Dominicans join the cast of an inescapable social drama wherein whites set the normative standard and ‘black people are viewed as a ‘them,’’ to borrow the language of Cornel West,” Torres-Saillant says. “For despite their particular manner of racial self-representation, Dominicans come into a society that, in the words of Frank Bonilla, ‘knows only black and white.’” Navigating American society, and its starkly different racial codes, as a Dominican immigrant, is a complex journey, a migration of its own if you will, that can transform what it fundamentally means to be Dominican outside of the Dominican Republic, in America.',

He argues that Black and mulatto Dominicans have not experienced the same history of racial brutality that African Americans have. Mixedness and racial purity in the Dominican Republic was not shunned in the way it was in the U.S., and thus, he argues, Dominicans develop a “deracialized social consciousness.” He argues, “Generally devoid of the language of racial polarity current in the United States, Dominicans have little familiarity with a discourse of black affirmation. Nothing in their history indicates to the masses of the Dominican people that their precarious material conditions or the overall indignities they suffer constitute a strictly racial form of oppression. As a result, they have not developed a discourse of black affirmation among their strategies of social resistance.

Thus, they have no difficulty recognizing a valid identity in their racial fusion.” Indeed, U.S.-educated Dominican poet Chiqui Vicioso, describes the state of mind of many Dominicans in the U.S. when she says, “Until I came to New York, I didn’t know I was black.” The “deracialized social consciousness” that Torres-Saillant describes can, perhaps, shed light on how Dominican immigrants, after arriving in New York, fight against a racially stratified system that insists on classifying and essentializing them according to race. It could be understood as a resistance, in a sense, to a white American culture that demands their racialization, even as Haitians are racialized by the Dominican government back at home. In this way, clinging onto one’s “deracialized social consciousness” after migrating to the U.S. could potentially open up different possibilities of being in the U.S., where one refuses the rigid and asphyxiating racial binary imposed by American white power to transcend its racial boundaries.',

He says, “There is clearly a long legacy of resistance to oppression championed by black slaves in the colonial period that contemporary Dominicans could draw from to empower themselves in their unending pursuit of social justice and full citizenship in a truly democratic society. Their uninterrupted history of subversive self-affirmation--going from the first black runaways that Ovando complains of in 1503 to the first slave insurrection on December 27, 1522 to our black Eve’s self-assertive dance in 1801 to the Monte Grande rebellion on February 28, 1844-- constitutes a veritable manifesto of human dignity that the African-descended majority of the Dominican population would draw inspiration from if it only knew about it. But it so happens that the people cannot benefit from the liberatory potential of that legacy because, for the most part, the history books used in the schools to educate the minds of the young as to the meaning of Dominicanness generally make no mention of it.” Thus, Torres-Saillant argues, many Dominican Americans have assumed racial and social consciousness’ which emanate, not from the history of Black liberation movements in Hispaniola, but rather from the Black liberation movement in the U.S. “A small contingent already exists in New York made up of individuals of various hues who think of themselves not as ‘Dominicans’ but as ‘Africans born in the Dominican Republic.’ Similarly Dominican youngsters who are brought up in this country, where bipolar racial categories reign supreme, are likely to adopt the racial classifications administered by their environment.”',

            description: 'In this sense, Dominican immigrants in the U.S., and their descendants, are able to develop an alternative social consciousness and meaning of Dominicanness outside of the physical and metaphysical borders imposed and enforced by the Dominican Republic. Beyond the migration numbers after Trujillo’s demise, this newfound agency rooted in Black liberation, is perhaps is the greatest consequence of the Dominican mass migrations to the U.S. Indeed, Torres-Saillant notes, “The historian Frank Moya Pons argued fifteen years ago that Dominicans discovered their ‘black roots’ in the United States and that they have in turn influenced their native land by returning home with their discovery. The scholar viewed ‘returning migrants’ as ‘new social agents of modernity, capitalism, and racial emancipation’ that had contributed to the overall transformation of ‘Dominican society and the Dominican mind,’ a claim that he illustrated by pointing to the vogue enjoyed in the Dominican Republic by hair styles, dress, popular music, and other expressions associated with American blacks as well as the popularity of dark-skinned artists and politicians.” The threat of returning migrants, whose social consiusness’ were reconfigured toward Black liberation, is perhaps, why Trujillo’s government imposed stiff restrictions on outward immigration by Dominicans during his rule — to keep Dominicans from accessing this radical and revolutionary social consciousness which, like the eternal Haitian dream of island unification, threatens the fall of the Dominican government and the dissolution of the border which has divided this island and its African-descended people for five centuries.”',

            description: 'This is a story of how race travels — how a people were captured into slavery, deracialized, divided, manipulated to reject their brethren on the “wrong” side of the line, fled to the freedom of a different country, were disoriented, reconfigured, and restored. There is an ungoverned liberatory power in Dominican poet’s Chiqui Vicioso’s statement, “Until I came to New York, I didn’t know I was black.” Descended from the first African slaves in the “New World,” though Dominican immigrants, in their lifetimes, may have only immigrated to the U.S., they have been in constant migration for five centuries. From Africa to Hispaniola to the United States, they have migrated not only physically, but also racially. Their racial affects and imaginaries have traveled with them for centuries since the start of the transatlantic slavery, and these affects have been shaped, challenged, reconfigured, and transformed along this journey. Dominican elites have historically weaponized the Haitian-Dominican border to develop a national Dominican “deracialized social consciousness” that simultaneously worked to purge Haitian “invaders” intent on unifying the island under Black sovereignty, while disarming the Dominican Black and mulatto population from engaging in Black liberatory struggle by suppressing African culture and expression. However with the fall of Trujillo’s white supremacist government, and the destabilization of the political structure in the Dominican Republic, mass waves of migration to the U.S. presented Dominican migrants, in search of possibilities, with a new and alternative understandings of what it means to Dominican. These newfound possibilities of being enable them to develop a radical social consciousness, outside the boundaries of Dominican borders, informed and shaped by Black liberation movements in the U.S., which they can wield to change the political and social landscape in the Dominican Republic if and when they return.',
