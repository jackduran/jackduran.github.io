         <p><span class="myDropcap">E</span> co-prisons. Feminist jails. Justice hubs. Reflection cottages. Therapeutic communities. Restorative villages. 21st century has given rise to a new generation of hydridized carceral experiments that fuse care and control into a new, more effective penal model, have been referred by James Kilgore (2014) as carceral humanism — the practice of repackaging carceral discipline and control as a benevolent social service. Jurisdictions, from North Dakota to New York City, are increasingly shifting away from conventionally punitive penal models and architectural styles and funding the construction of modern, flexible, and modular prisons that increasingly resemble office buildings — in an intentional effort to blend prisons into their surroundings through deceptively normalized aesthetics, rather than distinguishing them from their surroundings through imposing and intimidating designs as has been common practice in the last few centuries since the birth of the modern prison.<br><br> 

These trends reflect a growing emphasis by government officials — often lobbied by private actors, such as nonprofits, foundations, architects, urban designers, and real estate developers — on normalizing prisons. That is, completely reconstructing, renovating, and redesigning prison conditions to simulate the outside society in ways that enable prisons to placate critics by repositioning themselves as progressive and humane institutions. This, they say, is the future of corrections. Indeed, emphasizing high-performance, sustainability, mobility, interaction, and automation, these new-generation carceral models embrace neoliberal management strategies adopted in corporate workplaces that reimagine the prison as a space driven by, among other things, productivity, innovation, and optimization, and which rehabilitate incarcerated people, formerly excluded from the economy, into productive and contributing citizens, or what Michel Foucault terms, <em>homoeconomicus</em> — self-entrepreneurial subjects remade in service of the neoliberal order.<br><br>  

New jails are called “campuses.” Inmates are called “residents,” “clients,” and “apprentices.” Cell blocks are called “housing” and “communities.” Private consultants, from nonprofits to multinational corporations involved in carceral reform rebrand themselves as “disruptors,” and correctional guards as “professionals.” Incarceration, under this emerging neoliberal regime, is increasingly reframed as a “service” in a shift from more conventionally punitive models of corrections. And, the user-centered prison, reimagined as a medium of capitalism, itself becomes ever modern, transparent, mobilized, sustainable, adaptive, automated, modular, high-performing, replicable, generative, and reconfigurable.<br><br>
          
Calls to transform the violent, degrading, and corrupt culture of American prisons, if not outright abolish them, have enabled the emergence of global learning exchanges between prisons in different countries — what I term <em>carceral diplomacy</em> — as they turn abroad, particularly to Scandinavia, for a silver bullet to their problems. Ashley Kilmer and Ami Abdel-Salam (2022) write, “As U.S. policymakers continue to grapple with the damage wrought by mass incarceration, many have taken increasing interest in these ‘Scandinavian-style’ prisons, attempting to find ways to emulate their architecture, practices, and policies back in the states.”<br><br> 
          
With prison reform enjoying a détente amid a crisis in mass incarceration and a growing movement to abolish it, numerous U.S. jurisdictions across the country, such as North Dakota, Connecticut, and New York City — which is now embarking on the nation’s largest and most expensive jail construction project to replace its Rikers Island complex — have all recently sent delegations on study trips to European prisons with missions to learn, import, and transplant European penal models in the U.S. At the top of their itineraries is often Norway's Halden Prison — dubbed by Time Magazine, "the world's most humane prison."<br><br> 

What is it about Halden that has captured the attention of the world? And, why are prison reformers seeking to reimagine American prisons in its image? For the average American, it is hard to tell considering that prisons are often blackboxes to the public — out of sight and out of mind. This project seeks to open that black box, asking: What if instead of simply looking at photos of a new-generation prison, you could move through it and experience it? Reconstructed from dozens of photographs I have taken of Halden Prison as part of my work to document prison conditions, practices, and architecture in the U.S. and Europe, the following immersive 3D scene virtually walks you through a cell block of Halden Prison to get a glimpse of what reformers are working to replicate in America, and why looks are not always what they seem.

             <h2>AN IRON FIST IN A SILK GLOVE</h2>
             <p>Established in 2010, Halden Prison is something of a marvel, even a fetish, for American reformers increasingly looking to infuse prisons with the kinds of neoliberal-driven human-centered design strategies that are at the heart of Halden’s world-famous penal approach. “To anyone familiar with the American correctional system, Halden seems alien,” writes New York Times reporter, Jessica Benko. “Its modern, cheerful and well-appointed facilities, the relative freedom of movement it offers, its quiet and peaceful atmosphere — these qualities are so out of sync with the forms of imprisonment found in the United States that you could be forgiven for doubting whether Halden is a prison at all.” Still, critics argue that the fetishism of Halden’s aesthetic modernism by reformers has led them to ignore or overlook the actual lived experiences of the incarcerated people there who, despite Halden’s modern aesthetics, remark that it is, nevertheless, still a prison.</p>
